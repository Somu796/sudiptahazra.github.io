abstract: '*Aegle marmelos* (L.) is a seasonal fruit that contains significant amounts of bioactives like, phenolic acids (gallic acids, 2,3-dihydroxy benzoic acid, chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid, vanillic acid), flavonoid (rutin), organic acids (oxalic acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid), vitamin C, vitamin B group (thiamine, niacin, pyridoxine, pantothenic acid, biotin, cobalamins, riboflavin), tocopherols (α-tocopherol, β-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, δ-tocopherol), carotenes (α-carotene, β-carotene, γ-carotene, δ-carotene) and also rich in essential minerals (potassium, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, iron, copper, manganese). This study provides a comprehensive composition analysis (determined using RP-HPLC and Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) Spectroscopy). *In vitro* medicinal activities (antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-diabetic activity) are quantified for different bael samples. The study also investigates the changes of these bioactive components with freeze, sun, hot air, and microwave drying. The study gives a proper vision to preserve the nutraceutically rich pulp by converting it into fruit leather.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Aegle marmelos (bael) is rich in bioactives, vitamins, and essential minerals, with medicinal activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic effects. This study analyzes bioactive composition, drying effects, and preservation strategies to develop nutraceutically rich fruit leather.
