abstract: 'Proteomics have been extensively used in meat science to understand the biochemistry of meat quality. Identified and quantified proteomics data obtained through processing with analytical software tools, such as Mascot and Progenesis QI, among others, serve as a common starting point for meat scientists to analyze shotgun proteomic data. However, a standardized workflow for the downstream statistical analysis and visualization of these factorial design datasets is lacking. The workflow was developed using several R and Bioconductor packages including Tidyverse, UniprotR, QFeature, limma, EFS, ggplot2, pheatmap, ggvenn, and UpSetR, along with custom functions. The methodology is demonstrated using an experimental shotgun dataset preprocessed via Mascot and Progenesis QI. This dataset was derived from postmortem muscle tissues from a 2Ã—4 factorial study of cattle reared under two slaughter conditions and four feeding regimes. This workflow produced a result table with the gene name, UniProt accession, log2 fold change, p-value, and the corresponding adjusted p-value from the LFQ data. Publication-quality Venn diagrams, UpSet plots, volcano plots, and heat maps were generated. Dimensional reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP were integrated into the workflow. In addition, eight distinct feature selection techniques based on ensemble learning were applied using the EFS package, and the results were compared with differentially abundant proteins and visualized using a volcano plot. To enhance the readability, we implemented a strategy to present the correlation of large datasets more effectively. This R and Bioconductor-based workflow presents a consolidated resource of selected tools that facilitates downstream processing, statistical evaluation, and comprehensive visualization of shotgun proteomic data, thereby potentially enabling meat science researchers to address specific biological questions.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: An R and Bioconductor-based workflow was developed for standardized statistical analysis and visualization of shotgun proteomic data in meat science. The workflow integrates tools for dimensional reduction, feature selection, and visualization, enabling researchers to effectively analyze and interpret proteomic datasets from factorial design studies.
