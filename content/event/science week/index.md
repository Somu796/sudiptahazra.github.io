summary: Demonstrating the transformative potential of AI in animal farming through real-world use cases and hands-on engagement with young students.

abstract: 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing industries worldwide, including animal farming. From identifying bruising in livestock to predicting weight and counting animals, AI is becoming an integral part of modern agricultural practices. 

In this interactive session, I engaged with young school students to showcase the practical applications of AI in animal farming. Through hands-on demonstrations, I introduced them to real-world use cases and the potential of AI to transform traditional practices. Using a Python-based facial emotion recognition GUI, I highlighted how accessible tools can inspire innovation and open new opportunities in this field. 

This talk aims to spark curiosity and demonstrate how AI can be harnessed to solve challenges in animal farming, encouraging the next generation to explore the exciting possibilities of AI in agriculture.'
